<h2> Whoami: About-Me </h2>

<section class="aboutme">
    <p>Hey viewer, my name is
    <h4>Sahil</h4>. I am a Junior at Arizona State University. I am currently a Teaching Assistant for ASU's CSE-240:
    Principles of Programming, which is the first programming class introducing fundamental CS concepts such as terminal
    usage, memory management, and programming paradigms.</p>

    <h3>Interests and Skills</h3>
    <p>My interests include all things
    <h4>*NIX</h4>. I have been daily driving <h4>Arch Linux</h4> for almost 2 years. I also enjoy systems-level
    languages such as <h4>C, C++, Rust, and Go.</h4> I believe that while abstraction in programming languages is a
    powerful
    tool, it is often overused where there is no need. This belief guided me to use a very minimal tech stack when
    building this website.</p>

    <h3>Academic and Professional Experience</h3>
    <p>At ASU, I have worked as part of ASU Automation Projects' student led team, specifically on
    <h4>Attendance Management System or AMS</h4>, which is an automated attendance system integrated using ASU's card
    scanners and Canvas LMS</p>

    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <p>I have worked on a few projects on my free time. You can view all of them by either clicking on the
    <h4>Github</h4> button on the dock or by using <h4>"showcase" command.</h4>
    </p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>If youâ€™d like to get in touch, feel free to reach me at my email or linkedin by clicking the
    <h4>Gmail</h4> or <h4>Linkedin</h4> button on the dock. You can also use <h4>"ping" command </h4>
    </p>

    <h3>Resume</h3>
    <p> You can view my resume by clicking
    <h4>Resume</h4> button on the dock. You can also use <h4>"more" command </h4>
    </p>



    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>In the next few years, I aim to learn more while creating software I love.</p>
